                <span
                        class="bold">aspirant web-designer</span> .
                People may define me as a curious "multi-potentialist": I have many passions that I'd like to combine in
                one.
                Any sort of art really thrills me such as cinema, video-making, photography,dance, and most of all
                music,
                which has been part of my life since I was such a cutie tiny girl.
                At present I can play violin, piano, guitar and ukulele but I mostly enjoy composing songs.<br>
                Why? Well, composing and all my interests have a thing in common: <span class="bold">it's all about language learning</span>.<br>
                I've been learning four foreign languages (in addition to my mother tongue) because I love decrypting
                and
                manipulating symbols and sounds, in order to communicate. That's why logical and computing languages are
                very challenging to me.<br><br>
